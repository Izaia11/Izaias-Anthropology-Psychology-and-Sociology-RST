  <p><strong>Examine the cultural background, traditions, rituals, or belief systems that influenced the figure. Apply the following concepts and explain how each one connects to your figure.</strong></p>

  <h3>Cultural practices (What is this figure's culture and how do they practice it?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West is deeply embedded in African American culture, particularly within the spheres of hip-hop, gospel traditions, and urban Black identity. His cultural practices reflect a blend of secular and sacred experiences.</p>
  <p><strong>Music as cultural expressions:</strong> Kanye draws heavily on Black musical traditions, from soul sampling in his early albums to gospel influences in “Jesus is King”. His production style often nods at the communal and storytelling aspects of African American music.</p>
  <p><strong>Fashion and performance:</strong> Through Yeezy and his high-profile fashion endeavours, Kanye challenges mainstream definitions of Black aesthetics, contributing to Black visibility and cultural influence in high fashion.</p>
  <p><strong>Spiritual beliefs:</strong> Later in his career, Kanye emphasized Christianity, particularly evangelical forms, showing how personal faith can intersect with public performance and social commentary.</p>

  <h3>Kinship (What is this figure's family system and how does it influence them?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West comes from a non-traditional but influential family background.</p>
  <p><strong>Mother:</strong> Donda West, a professor of English and a major influence in Kanye’s life played a pivotal role in shaping his intellectual and artistic identity. Her death in 2007 deeply affected him and is frequently referenced in his music.</p>
  <p><strong>Father:</strong> Ray West, a former Black Panther and photojournalist, exposed Kanye to activism and creative expression.</p>
  <p><strong>Marriage and Children:</strong> His marriage to Kim Kardashian introduced him to a new kind of kinship network, celebrity culture, and social media family dynamics. This relationship significantly shaped public perceptions of him and influenced his media presence.</p>
  <p>Kinship for Kanye is both biological and symbolic, his extended family includes musical collaborators like Jay-Z (once referred to as a brother), and his fans, who he often addresses in a familial tone.</p>

  <h3>Sociolinguistics (How does this figure use language? Do they speak in a certain way that indicates their background or social group?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West’s use of language reflects his cultural hybridity and social commentary.</p>
  <p><strong>Code-Switching:</strong> Kanye often blends African American Vernacular English (AAVE) with more standard or elite forms of speech, signalling his navigation between Black cultural spaces and mainstream white-dominated industries.</p>
  <p><strong>Lyrics and persona:</strong> Some say Kanye is a lyrical genius, his lyrics are layered with slang, metaphor, religious references, and political critique, putting him within a tradition of hip-hop as a form of resistance and storytelling.</p>
  <p><strong>Public Speech:</strong> His interviews and public statements often appear erratic or unconventional. This has been read both as a symptom of mental health struggles and as a challenge to normative public discourse, especially around race, celebrity, and autonomy.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Kanye West shows how an individual can both reflect and shape culture through music, language, family structures, and belief systems. His life and work serve as case studies of how modern identity is formed at the crossing of traditions, innovation, and controversy.</p>

  <h2>Psychology</h2>
  <!-- Section image -->
  <img class="section-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Brain_icon.svg" alt="Brain Icon" />
  
  <p><strong>Analyze internal and external influences on the individual’s behaviour, personality and decision-making. Analyze the before and after Kanye West's mental breakdown and state notable changes.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Apply some psychological theories such as Freud's psychoanalysis, Jung's analytic psychology, behaviourism, humanism, and developmental psychology.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Consider if the figure may suffer from any of the psychological disorders as listed in the DSM-5-TR (whether confirmed or based on your observations)</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Public Persona:</strong> Outspoken, talented, controversial musician and fashion designer.</p>
  <p><strong>Mental Health Disclosure:</strong> Kanye has publicly stated he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, referring to it as his “superpower”.</p>

  <h3>Key life-altering events</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2007: Death of his mother, Donda West</li>
    <li>2016: Public breakdown episodes, including hospitalization</li>
    <li>Marriage and subsequent divorce with Kim Kardashian</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Before Breakdown</h3>
  <p>He was widely celebrated for his creative genius, although some noticed erratic behaviour early on.</p>

  <h3>After Breakdown</h3>
  <p>Kanye's behaviour became more unpredictable publicly, including controversial statements and erratic interviews.</p>

  <h3>Freud’s psychoanalysis</h3>
  <p>The tension between Kanye’s id (impulses for creativity and fame) and superego (moral/ethical considerations influenced by faith and family) is evident. His ego attempts to mediate this but struggles under stress.</p>

  <h3>Jung’s analytic psychology</h3>
  <p>Kanye exhibits archetypes like the “Rebel” and “Creator.” His personal shadow side (struggles, mental illness) is a significant aspect of his public persona.</p>

  <h3>Behaviorism</h3>
  <p>Reinforcement from fan admiration and celebrity status may encourage continued outspokenness despite social backlash.</p>

  <h3>Humanism</h3>
  <p>Kanye’s pursuit of self-actualization is evident in his artistic and entrepreneurial ventures, and his public struggles can be seen as a journey towards personal growth.</p>

  <h3>Developmental psychology</h3>
  <p>Loss of his mother during early adulthood likely disrupted normal development stages, causing long-term effects.</p>

  <h3>Mental health disorders</h3>
  <p>Kanye’s symptoms align with bipolar disorder as described in the DSM-5-TR, including mood swings, grandiosity, and impulsive behavior.</p>

  <p><strong>Analyze the figure using sociological theories such as Functionalism, Conflict Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and the Social Construction of Reality.</strong></p>

  <h3>Functionalism</h3>
  <p>Kanye West serves as a cultural institution that contributes to social cohesion through music, fashion, and public discourse. His work helps reinforce shared norms and values in society, especially around creativity and fame.</p>

  <h3>Conflict Theory</h3>
  <p>His career highlights tensions around class, race, and power. Kanye’s outspoken critiques of the music industry, media, and society point to systemic inequalities and struggles over cultural capital.</p>

  <h3>Symbolic Interactionism</h3>
  <p>Kanye’s identity is constantly negotiated through interactions with fans, media, and peers. His use of language, fashion, and public behavior construct his social self.</p>

  <h3>Social Construction of Reality</h3>
  <p>The public narrative around Kanye is shaped by media representations and social expectations, showing how reality is co-created by multiple actors in society.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Kanye West’s life and work demonstrate the complex interplay between individual agency and social structure.</p>
