<h1>Kanye West</h1>
<p><strong>Before meltdown</strong></p>

<section>
  <h2>Anthropology</h2>
  <p><strong>Examine the cultural background, traditions, rituals, or belief systems that influenced the figure. Apply the following concepts and explain how each one connects to your figure.</strong></p>

  <h3>Cultural practices (What is this figure's culture and how do they practice it?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West is deeply embedded in African American culture, particularly within the spheres of hip-hop, gospel traditions, and urban Black identity. His cultural practices reflect a blend of secular and sacred experiences.</p>
  <p><strong>Music as cultural expressions:</strong> Kanye draws heavily on Black musical traditions, from soul sampling in his early albums to gospel influences in “Jesus is King”. His production style often nods at the communal and storytelling aspects of African American music.</p>
  <p><strong>Fashion and performance:</strong> Through Yeezy and his high-profile fashion endeavours, Kanye challenges mainstream definitions of Black aesthetics, contributing to Black visibility and cultural influence in high fashion.</p>
  <p><strong>Spiritual beliefs:</strong> Later in his career, Kanye emphasized Christianity, particularly evangelical forms, showing how personal faith can intersect with public performance and social commentary.</p>

  <h3>Kinship (What is this figure's family system and how does it influence them?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West comes from a non-traditional but influential family background.</p>
  <p><strong>Mother:</strong> Donda West, a professor of English and a major influence in Kanye’s life played a pivotal role in shaping his intellectual and artistic identity. Her death in 2007 deeply affected him and is frequently referenced in his music.</p>
  <p><strong>Father:</strong> Ray West, a former Black Panther and photojournalist, exposed Kanye to activism and creative expression.</p>
  <p><strong>Marriage and Children:</strong> His marriage to Kim Kardashian introduced him to a new kind of kinship network, celebrity culture, and social media family dynamics. This relationship significantly shaped public perceptions of him and influenced his media presence.</p>
  <p>Kinship for Kanye is both biological and symbolic, his extended family includes musical collaborators like Jay-Z (once referred to as a brother), and his fans, who he often addresses in a familial tone.</p>

  <h3>Sociolinguistics (How does this figure use language? Do they speak in a certain way that indicates their background or social group?)</h3>
  <p>Kanye West’s use of language reflects his cultural hybridity and social commentary.</p>
  <p><strong>Code-Switching:</strong> Kanye often blends African American Vernacular English (AAVE) with more standard or elite forms of speech, signalling his navigation between Black cultural spaces and mainstream white-dominated industries.</p>
  <p><strong>Lyrics and persona:</strong> Some say Kanye is a lyrical genius, his lyrics are layered with slang, metaphor, religious references, and political critique, putting him within a tradition of hip-hop as a form of resistance and storytelling.</p>
  <p><strong>Public Speech:</strong> His interviews and public statements often appear erratic or unconventional. This has been read both as a symptom of mental health struggles and as a challenge to normative public discourse, especially around race, celebrity, and autonomy.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Kanye West shows how an individual can both reflect and shape culture through music, language, family structures, and belief systems. His life and work serve as case studies of how modern identity is formed at the crossing of traditions, innovation, and controversy.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Psychology</h2>
  <p><strong>Analyze internal and external influences on the individual’s behaviour, personality and decision-making. Analyze the before and after Kanye West's mental breakdown and state notable changes.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Apply some psychological theories such as Freud's psychoanalysis, Jung's analytic psychology, behaviourism, humanism, and developmental psychology.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Consider if the figure may suffer from any of the psychological disorders as listed in the DSM-5-TR (whether confirmed or based on your observations)</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Public Persona:</strong> Outspoken, talented, controversial musician and fashion designer.</p>
  <p><strong>Mental Health Disclosure:</strong> Kanye has publicly stated he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, referring to it as his “superpower”.</p>

  <h3>Key life-altering events</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2007: Death of his mother, Donda West</li>
    <li>2016: Hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency (“temporary psychosis due to sleep deprivation and dehydration”).</li>
    <li>Post 2016: Exhibits increasingly erratic behaviour, including presidential run, antisemitic comments, inappropriate Twitter statements, and public conflicts (Bad choices of Free Will).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Internal vs External Influences</h3>
  <p><strong>Internal Influences:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biological factors: Kanye’s bipolar diagnosis suggests a genetic or neurochemical predisposition.</li>
    <li>Personality: Traits of high openness, narcissism, creativity, and impulsivity.</li>
    <li>Trauma/Grief: The death of his mother was a profound internal emotional loss. (Some say this was the first motion to get the stone rolling). He also had a near-death experience after being in a bad car accident.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>External Influences:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fame and Pressure: Constant public scrutiny, media distortion, and celebrity status.</li>
    <li>Relationships: High-profile relationships (Like Kim Kardashian) and public breakups.</li>
    <li>Social Media: Allows impulsive and unfiltered expressions, sometimes reinforcing instability.</li>
    <li>Cultural factors: Societal stigmas around Black men’s mental health and masculinity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Before vs After his Mental Breakdown</h3>
  <p><strong>Before (Pre 2016)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creative Genius: Albums like “The College Dropout”, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”, and “Graduation” showcased his ability to embrace and truly make beautiful and meaningful music.</li>
    <li>Cocky but Controlled: Known for his ego and confidence, but often framed within his artistry.</li>
    <li>Emotional Depth: His grief post-Donda’s death was present, but mostly artistically challenged. He felt like he found peace in it, turned to god, and embraced the beauty of life and the challenges that it will throw in your face.</li>
    <li>Pre 2016 Kanye was a force to be reckoned with, most young individuals knew about him and a lot were very influenced by him. I think he was one of the most influential people in the music industry of the 21st century.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>After (Post-2016)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Erratic Behaviour: Speech patterns became more disjointed and confused. Public outbursts and controversial statements increased.</li>
    <li>Polarizing figure: His support of controversial figures (e.g., Donald Trump, and statements supporting Hitler) alienated much of his fanbase.</li>
    <li>Isolation: His withdrawal from music at certain points and focus on political or religious agendas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Psychological Theories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Freud’s Psychoanalysis:</strong> Kanye’s ego and superego struggle publicly, with the id driving impulsive outbursts, and the superego conflicted by societal norms.</li>
    <li><strong>Jung’s Analytic Psychology:</strong> The “shadow” aspect is visible in Kanye’s acceptance of his flaws and darkness in public persona, along with his “self” seeking wholeness.</li>
    <li><strong>Behaviourism:</strong> Reinforcement through social media praise and controversy drives some of his behaviour.</li>
    <li><strong>Humanism:</strong> Kanye’s pursuit of self-actualization is seen in his continuous innovation, despite setbacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Developmental Psychology:</strong> Traumatic losses and early life experiences shaped his adult personality and coping mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mental Health Diagnosis</h3>
  <p>While Kanye West’s bipolar disorder diagnosis is public, some behaviours could also indicate symptoms of other disorders or acute episodes, such as psychosis or delusional thinking, especially during manic phases.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Sociology</h2>
  <p><strong>Analyze the social environment, groups, and institutions that influenced the figure.</strong></p>

  <h3>Agents of Socialization</h3>
  <p>Kanye West was heavily influenced by his family, especially his mother, Donda West, who fostered his creativity and confidence (Rolling Stone, 2007). His peers in Chicago’s hip-hop scene helped shape his musical direction, while the media played a significant role in constructing his public image. His education (dropping out of college) became central to his identity as an artist. More recently, religion has become a major force through his Sunday Service gatherings and gospel albums.</p>

  <h3>Sociological Concepts</h3>
  <p><strong>Norms:</strong> Kanye both follows and breaks norms in music and fashion, often challenging societal expectations (BBC News, 2009).</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Kanye West’s life is a complex interplay of social structures, norms, and individual agency, reflecting broader patterns in contemporary society related to fame, mental health, race, and media.</p>
